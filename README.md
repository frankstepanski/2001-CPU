# üìö 2001-CPU

Hi! This is 2001s GitHub repository! We are going to push all relevant code to this repo. This will allow you to look back on code examples, and anything else we find pertinent.

We will try to keep this updated but please reach out to use on slack for any help!

## Using

FYI, the folder structure visibily available above is something you can click through to get to files, and then read the files.

## Warning

Don't copy code. It just cheats yourself out of an education and struggle from trying to write it yourself! If we find you abusing this, we will change access to this. Its even better to rewrite it by hand then copy paste it so that you get used to typing code.
