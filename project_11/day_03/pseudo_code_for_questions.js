// - how to store the token and username in state? âœ…
//   - We get the token by using our username, so the username has to be made available first.
// - Once we have that, we probably do a ternary in terms of "how" to get the token.
// - Check localstorage, if its there, attempt to use that.
// - If its not there, go fetch a new one, and attempt to use that.
// - If the token you attempted to use works, store it in state (and localStorage if its new).
// - If it didn't work, its likely expired, so you'll have to re-login to get the token, then store in state/localStorage.

// Eventually username would never be hardcoded, even if this is what we wanted - by that i mean we the developer are using our email - we would actually pass it in as whats called an ENV variable, or as a cli argument. The reason for this is to omit it from github, or people reading our source code.
