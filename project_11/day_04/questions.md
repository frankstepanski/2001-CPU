# Questions/Concepts for Tuesday Demo

- State
  - Demo of how to use it practically
- `map` or `reduce` used to render/deal with an array of objects
  - When to use?  
  - Example? 
- Demo for Event handlers besides click handlers. (i.e. keyboard events, paste events, hover events...)
- When to use Async/Await and when to use Promise (Can/should they be used together?  Is one better than the other?)
- How to render a div if something exists on state (i.e. base it off `state.username`, as an alternative to using css to show/hide stuff on the page)
