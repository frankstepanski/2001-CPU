- âœ… Demo of mapping over state
    - State
      - Demo of how to use it practically
    - `map` or `reduce` used to render/deal with an array of objects
      - When to use?
      - Example?
    - How to render a div if something exists on state (i.e. base it off `state.username`, as an alternative to using css to show/hide stuff on the page)
- Do something cool?
  - Demo for Event handlers besides click handlers. (i.e. keyboard events, paste events, hover events...)
- The battle of the decade
  - When to use Async/Await and when to use Promise (Can/should they be used together?  Is one better than the other?)
